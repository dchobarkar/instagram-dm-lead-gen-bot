# Instagram DM Lead Capture Bot ðŸ¤–

Instagram is no longer just a photo-sharing app â€” it's a full-fledged engagement platform. In this project, weâ€™re building an **Instagram DM chatbot** that helps businesses:

- Automatically reply to incoming messages
- Guide users through a mini lead capture flow (name, email, interest)
- Store captured leads in Supabase
- Run on a Node.js + Express backend (with TypeScript + pnpm)

## ðŸ’¡ Why Instagram DMs?

- Over **2 billion monthly active users**
- 80â€“90% open rate for messages ðŸ“¬
- Users respond to DMs more than emails or forms

Businesses thrive where users already hang out â€” and that place is Instagram DMs.

## ðŸ§  What Makes DM Bots Special?

- âœ… Real-time conversations, not static forms
- âœ… Rich UX: Quick replies, emojis, images
- âœ… User handles attached to every message
- âœ… Strong engagement coming from Stories, Reels, and Posts

## ðŸ›  What We'll Build

- A webhook-enabled Express server
- Verified integration with Meta's Instagram Messaging API
- A guided lead collection flow via DMs
- Supabase storage for captured leads

- `TypeScript`
